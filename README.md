# Async Module Definition application boilerplate

In short, this is a very basic modular deligation pattern application boilerplate build on `require.js`, `HTML5bp`, `jQuery`, `backbone`, `underscore` and `modernizr`.  Some useful functionality is built into the `app` module.  

**Very much a work in progress... to be fleshed out soon.**
